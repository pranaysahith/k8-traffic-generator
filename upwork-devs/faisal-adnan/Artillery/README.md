# Artillery PoC
Create a pod that executes test using Artillery
# Quick Start 
This project execute a test scenario by running it in 1 to N pods.
The pod generates the following data:
1. The test log is shipped to ELK
2. The test report is uploaded to Minio.
3. The http tracing is sent to Zipkin or Jaeger.

See the diagram below:
